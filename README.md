# Intro

**Microsoft and CDDO** are thrilled to invite you to our **UK Gov Azure Conference**, a **two-day event** designed to bring together thought leaders, innovators, and technology enthusiasts from the public sector. This conference will be held on the 15th and 16th of July and promises to be an enlightening experience, showcasing the latest advancements and practical applications of Azure technologies in government.

## Day 1

Our event is split into two days, you can attend one or both but we'd love to see you at both!

**Day 1** has a Business Focus, Talks and Topics intended to inspire Business Decision Makers, Project Managers, Team Leads and just about anyone who works in and around tech!

## Day 2

**Day 2** Has a Technical Focus - Expect more in-depth technical talks, live coding and tutorial sessions!

Anyone can attend these sessions but be prepared to see a little less PowerPoint and a bit more Python!

## The Location - Manchester UA92 

üè¢ **Manchester** is rapidly emerging as a powerhouse in the tech industry, boasting a formidable digital tech ecosystem valued at ¬£5 billion. The city is home to over 10,000 tech companies, making it the most digitally inclusive city in the UK. Last year, Manchester‚Äôs tech start-ups raised a record ¬£532 million, reflecting steady venture capital investment since 2018.

üéì **UA92** represents a pioneering collaboration between Microsoft and University Academy 92 (UA92), aimed at bridging the digital skills gap and fostering a new generation of tech-savvy professionals. What better place to hold a conference?

## Government Collaboration

**We heard your feedback**, last year you told us you'd like to see more of a focus on Government Collaboration and networking that's why this year:

 1. Your **Government Colleagues will share the stage with Microsoft**, sharing stories about how they've bought technology to life in their departments
 2. Our **venue is bigger** leaving more space for networking and collaboration to happen outside of the main events.

## Get Involved!
We still have some speaker slots avaliable to anyone out in UK Government who would love to showcase what they're doing. Remember there will only be Government and Microsoft staff in attendence allowing you to share freely.
